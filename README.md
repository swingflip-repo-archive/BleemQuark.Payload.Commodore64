# BleemQuark for the Commodore 64 Mini 

This is a prototype modification tool by Swingflip which is intended to bolt in to the "big picture" projet based on previous hack written and the FEL-less payload by JJ-0

This projet is WIP and shouldn't be released unless explicitly told it's ok to do so.
